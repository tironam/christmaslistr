# Gift Listr 1.0

Formerly known as Christmas Listr. A simple wishlist app that reads from and writes to a MySQL database, with help from JawsDB on HEroku. 

## Installation

Once cloned down, run "npm i" in the console to install all the necessary npm packages.

## Usage

Free to use and work with, however this 1.0 version only reads and writes to one table in a database, so any changes made to the list will appear for anyone viewing the app.

## Contributing
